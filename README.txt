README for Text Generation

Original author: Morgan McKinney 4/2021

Machine learning generation of Shakespearean text using a recurrent neural network. Reads in original Shakespeare text and outputs uniquely generated Shakespearean text.

Network trains using included Shakespeare text dataset. There is no need for user input to run. The network will output loss at given intervals to illustrate how well it is learning throughout runtime.

Although the program runs using the provided Shakespeare dataset, the text is easily interchangable and the model should adjust accordingly.

main.py: RNN model, corpus segmentation, training, and sampling all included.
